# WildFly embedded broker used as a remote broker

In this example we are deploying 3 WildFly applications on OpenShift:

* A broker configured with a persistent storage to store not delivered messages.
* A jms message provider. A servlet that sends messages to a queue.
* A jms consumer. An MDB EJB that consumes messages.

The builder and runtime images are running JDK11.

# WildFly Maven plugin configuration

## Galleon feature-packs

* `org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack`
* `org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack`

## Galleon layers

* `cloud-server`, for the 3 applications.
* `ejb`, for the mdb consumer only.
* `embedded-activemq`, for the jms broker only.

## CLI scripts
WildFly CLI scripts executed at packaging time

CLI scripts are run in order to fine tune the 3 servers:

* `broker`: To create HELLOWORLDMDBTopic and HELLOWORLDMDBQueue, disable security and configure journal path to reference persistent volumes.
* `producer`: To create external topic and queue, configure socket binding to the remote broker, pooled connection factory and http-connector.
* `mdb-consumer`: To create external topic and queue, configure socket binding to the remote broker, pooled connection factory and http-connector.

NB: In order to adapt the configuration to the execution context, the expression `${env.BROKER_HOST}` 
is set in the producer and mdb-consumer socket-binding `host` attribute value. The env variable is set in the WildFly Helm chart yaml file.

## Extra content
Extra content packaged inside the provisioned servers

* None

# Openshift build and deployment
Technologies required to build and deploy this example

* Helm chart for WildFly `wildfly/wildfly`. Minimal version `2.0.0`.

# WildFly image API
Environment variables from the [WildFly image API](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/main/jboss/container/wildfly/run/api/module.yaml) that must be set in the OpenShift deployment environment

* None

# WildFly cloud feature-pack added features

* The remote connection factory is configured with `reconnect-attempts=-1`, allowing the clients to reconnect when the broker is down. 

# Pre-requisites

* You are logged into an OpenShift cluster and have `oc` command in your path

* You have installed Helm. Please refer to [Installing Helm page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Helm in your environment

* You have installed the repository for the Helm charts for WildFly

 ```
helm repo add wildfly https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/
```
----
**NOTE**

If you have already installed the Helm Charts for WildFly, make sure to update your repository to the latest version.

```
helm repo update
```

# Example steps

1. Create the persistent volume.

```
oc create -f broker/jms-volume-claim.yaml
```

2. Deploy the broker using WildFly Helm charts

```
helm install jms-broker -f broker/helm.yaml wildfly/wildfly
```

3. Deploy the producer using WildFly Helm charts

```
helm install jms-producer -f producer/helm.yaml wildfly/wildfly
```

4. Deploy the consumer using WildFly Helm charts

```
helm install mdb-consumer -f mdb-consumer/helm.yaml wildfly/wildfly
```

Wait for the pods to be ready. It can takes some minutes for the images to be built and deployed.
You can check the status of the pods by calling: `oc get pods -w`.


5. Produces messages

`curl https://$(oc get route jms-producer --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/HelloWorldMDBServletClient`

Check the logs of the mdb-consumer, you will see the traces of the received messages.

# Broker failure scenario, messages are persisted

1. Scale down the mdb-consumer

`oc scale --replicas=0 deployments mdb-consumer`

2. Produces messages

`curl https://$(oc get route jms-producer --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/HelloWorldMDBServletClient`

These messages are persisted, waiting for a consumer to come online.

3. Scale down the broker, emulates a failure.

`oc scale --replicas=0 deployments jms-broker`

4. Scale up the broker

`oc scale --replicas=1 deployments jms-broker`

5. Scale up the mdb-consumer

`oc scale --replicas=1 deployments mdb-consumer`

Once the pod is ready, you will notice in the log that the messages are getting delivered.
