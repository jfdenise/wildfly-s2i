# Release Process

## SNAPSHOT images

The versions of the builder and runtime images are of the form: `1.x.x-jdkX-snapshot`.

When a change that impacts the images is pushed in [wildfly-s2i](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i) or 
[wildfly-cekit-modules](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules) repositories main branches,  
new snapshot images are deployed to the `quay.io/wildfly-snapshots` organization.

## Releasing new images

### Release new images

* Tag [wildfly-cekit-modules](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules) if needed.
* Ask for a tag in [openjdk s2i image](https://github.com/jboss-container-images/openjdk) modules repo if needed.
* In the wildfly-s2i main branch, update the wildfly-builder-image/jdkX-overrides.yaml files and wildfly-runtime-image/jdkX-overrides.yaml files 
versions from `1.x.x-jdkX-snapshot` to `1.x.x-jdkX` and use the new `wildfly-cekit-modules` and `openjdk` tags as `ref`.
* Open PR, tests are green, merge PR in main.
* CI job on push build and deploy the images in `quay.io`, detects that the version is not a `snapshot`, deploy images in `quay.io/wildfly` organization 
and creates â€œlatest, latest-jdkX" image tags.
* Tag wildfly-s2i  branch (eg: `1.0.0-jdkX`), push tag.

### Switch back to snapshot

* In the wildfly-s2i main branch, update the wildfly-builder-image/jdkX-overrides.yaml files and wildfly-runtime-image/jdkX-overrides.yaml files  
versions to `1.x.(x+1)-jdkX-snapshot` and use `main` ref for wildfly-cekit-modules and `ubi8` ref for openjdk.
* Open PR. Merge. New snapshot images will be built and pushed in `quay.io/wildfly-snapshots` organisation.
