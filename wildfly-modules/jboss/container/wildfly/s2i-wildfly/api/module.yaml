description: Env variable to configure the server for cloud execution. JVM is automatically configured, all Java related env variables are supported.

envs:
- name: PORT_OFFSET
  description: Use this env variable to set the server port offset. This is advised practice instead of directly setting jboss.socket.binding.port-offset in the SERVER_ARGS. It allows the server shutdown logic to connect to the running server to do a clean CLI shutdown. 
- name: CLI_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN
  description: Set this variable to true to disable server shutdown. You are then in charge to explicitly kill the server by your own mean.
- name: JBOSS_NODE_NAME
  description: Set jboss.node.name property value. By default a truncated to 23 characters name based on the hostname is computed.
- name: SERVER_ARGS
  description: In order to provide arguments to the launched server.
- name: SERVER_PUBLIC_BIND_ADDRESS
  description: By default the public interface is bound to the hostname ip address. You can change this default using this env variable.
- name: SERVER_MANAGEMENT_BIND_ADDRESS
  description: By default the public interface is bound to 0:0:0:0 address. You can change this default using this env variable.
